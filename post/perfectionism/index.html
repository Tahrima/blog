<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would go as far as to say that I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder but sometimes my need for a thing to be perfect is crippling. It gets in the way of my productivity. Example right here &ndash; it&rsquo;s been way too many times I&rsquo;ve tried to start up a blog only to convince myself that a particular version wasn&rsquo;t good enough and I needed to remake the website, or worse, learn how to do it another way.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>And even now while I&rsquo;m writing this post up, I&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to promise I won&rsquo;t change up this site again in a few days time. Buuut at least I can say I am proud of myself for getting this far tonight! Right? Right&hellip;? (This is where I remember my night involved trying an array of color palettes and fonts before &ldquo;settling&rdquo; on what I have now&hellip; ha ha ha it hurts to laugh)</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>It would be one thing if perfectionism was fulfilling; it&rsquo;s not at all. It&rsquo;s really, really not. Well sometimes, you might feel a glimmering sense of achievement after making something you only kinda like and having others validate you that no, in fact you did not waste ALL your time. But if that is really only the reward, it&rsquo;s puzzling why I haven&rsquo;t fought this urge more proactively in my life. I&rsquo;ve even prided myself in being a perfectionist on more than one occasion.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>The truth is the urge to make something perfect does not conveniently come with the knowledge to do so. That knowledge only comes with practice and learning from your mistakes. How can we even conceptualize and make something good if we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s bad? It&rsquo;s quite the fun paradox.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Taking on a project with a perfectionist mindset means setting out to find out what perfect means in every context of the project and then applying it. While I once found that a courageous endeavor, I can&rsquo;t see it being anything more than foolish now. Figuring out the best way to do everything in the scope of one task is essentially trying to fill in those knowledge gaps overnight. We will end up making  mistakes, trying to learn from them in rapid succession so as to create as great as the-state-of-the-art. (Yeah, ok.)</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>From experience, I can say this type of behavior lends itself easily to getting too far down the rabbit hole. And getting frustrated at not making any significant progress. And even when some progress is made and we&rsquo;ve identified what the-state-of-the-art is, we see how far we really are from being able to create something as great. It is paralyzing. How could we ever reach THAT? Such is the curse of perfectionism.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>My, that&rsquo;s bleak. I didn&rsquo;t realize my first post would sound so depressing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to be perfect, you&rsquo;ll never get there blah blah insert more bitter commentary here&rdquo;. I really don&rsquo;t mean it like that. All I want to do is to remind myself and others to trust the learning process. Don&rsquo;t quit because it&rsquo;s not perfect. Make things that are bad, then mediocre, and then good. Just keep on trucking and you will get where you wanted to be. This is generally the easier way to towards making something great.</p>
